---

## Technical Debt & Follow-ups

### High Priority (Phase 1)
1. **Replace float with Decimal for money calculations**
   - Location: app/engine/risk_manager.py, app/adapters/broker_binance.py
   - Impact: Precision errors in P&L, risk limits
   - Effort: 2-3 hours

2. **Add Pydantic configuration validation**
   - Location: app/engine/runner_live.py
   - Impact: Runtime errors from malformed configs
   - Effort: 4-6 hours

3. **Implement comprehensive input validation**
   - Location: Multiple modules (data sources, strategies)
   - Impact: Unexpected behavior, potential security issues
   - Effort: 6-8 hours

### Medium Priority (Phase 2)
4. Define Pydantic schemas for all API responses
5. Implement circuit breaker pattern for external APIs
6. Add exponential backoff to retry logic
7. Generate API documentation with Sphinx

### Low Priority (Phase 3+)
8. Increase test coverage target to 75%
9. Add property-based testing with hypothesis
10. Create deployment runbooks
11. Add performance benchmarks
